# Hi!ðŸ‘‹
This is the script for a reddit bot. Which uses Python reddit API wrapper (PRAW).

# Prerequisites:
  - Create a reddit account for the bot.
  - **Create an app**:
      - Visit this [reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/).
      - Name your app.
      - Select the "script" option.
      - Enter "http://localhost" in the redirect uri field.
      - Press the "Create app" button.
      - After your app has been created you'll get the 'client id' and 'client secret' credentials.

# How to use the bot:
  - Run the Python code in your IDE / Text editor.
  - You'll be prompted to enter the following credentials.
      - Reddit Username.
      - Reddit Password.
      - Client Id.
      - Client Secret.
      - User agent (You can enter whatever you want, but try to make it unique).
   - After entering the credentials you'll be logged in and a menu of options will come up.
   - All the main functions expected from a typical reddit bot are included in the code and ready to use.
   - With basic python programming you can modify the bot to suit your needs.

Here is a guide to all the features (and their status) provided by the bot:
